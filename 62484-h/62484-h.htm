<h3 id="c13"><i>Directions for Starching Doilies</i></h3>
<p><b>STARCH:</b> Dissolve &frac14; cup starch in &frac12; cup of cold water.
Boil slowly over a low flame, as it thickens stir in gradually
about 1&frac14; cups of cold water. Boil, stirring constantly
until starch clears. This makes a thick pasty mixture.</p>
<p>As soon as starch is cool enough to handle, dip doily and
squeeze starch through it thoroughly. Wring out extra
starch. The doily should be wet with starch but there
should be none in the spaces. Pin center of doily in position
according to size and leave until thoroughly dry. If
steam iron is used iron ruffle after it is dry. If regular iron
is used dampen ruffle slightly before pressing. Pin folds
of ruffle in position and leave until thoroughly dry.</p>
